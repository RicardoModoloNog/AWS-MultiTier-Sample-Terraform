AWS Multi-Tier Architecture with Terraform

Overview

This project deploys a multi-tier AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes network, security, application, and load balancing components to create a scalable and modular architecture.

Features

✅ Modular Terraform Design – Easy to manage and extend.
✅ Scalable Network Setup – VPC, Subnets, and Routing.
✅ Security Best Practices – IAM roles, Security Groups, and least privilege access.
✅ Load Balancer Integration – Distributes traffic efficiently.
✅ Application Deployment – Automates EC2 instance provisioning.

Infrastructure Components

1. Networking

VPC with Public and Private Subnets

Internet Gateway and Route Tables

NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access

2. Security

Security Groups for EC2 and Load Balancer

IAM Roles with necessary permissions

SSH Key Pair Configuration

3. Compute & Application Layer

EC2 Instances for the application tier

Auto Scaling Group (if configured)

4. Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Listener Rules for traffic distribution

File Structure

Prerequisites

Terraform installed (Download)

AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions (Guide)

Deployment Steps

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

2️⃣ Initialize Terraform: terraform init (use "terraform validate" after that to check)

3️⃣ Plan the deployment: terraform plan

4️⃣ Apply the infrastructure: terraform apply (if necessary, uste "terraform apply -auto-approve" for automatic approval)

5️⃣ Get output values (e.g., Load Balancer URL):

Destroying the Infrastructure

To remove all resources: terraform destroy -auto-approve

Future Improvements

> Implement Auto Scaling Groups for high availability

> Configure RDS for database management
